# StringDataTYpe
Software Engineering Boot Camp - Task 5

Compulsory Task 1
Follow these steps:
● Create a new Python file in this folder called “Strings.py”
● Declare the variable called hero that contains the value “Super Man”
● Print it out in the following way:
○ S^U^P^E^R M^A^N

Compulsory Task 2
Follow these steps:
● Create a new Python file in this folder called “Replace.py”
● Save the sentence: “The!quick!brown!fox!jumps!over!the!lazy!dog!” as a
single string.
● Now reprint this sentence as “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy
dog” using the replace() function to replace every “!” exclamation mark
with a blank space.
● Now reprint that sentence as “THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE
LAZY DOG” using the upper() function
● Print the sentence in reverse.

Compulsory Task 3
Follow these steps:
● Create a new Python file in this folder called “Manipulation.py”
● Ask the user to enter a sentence. Save the user’s response in a variable
called strManip.
● Using this string value, write the code to do the following:
○ Calculate and display the length of strManip.
○ Find the last letter in strManip. Replace every occurence of this
letter in strManip with ‘@’. E.g. if strManip = “This sentence contains
words”, the output would be “Thi@ @entence contain@ word@”.
○ Print the last 3 characters in strManip backwards. E.g. if strManip =
“This sentence contains words”, the output would be “sdr”.
○ Create a five letter word that is made up of the first three characters
and the last two characters in strManip. E.g. if strManip = “This
sentence contains words”, the output would be “Thids”.
○ Display each word in the sentence on a new line.
